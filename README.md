# Online-reservation-system
 The project is an Online Reservation System designed to streamline the process of booking and canceling train tickets. Its main objective is to provide users with a convenient and efficient platform for managing their travel arrangements. Here's a detailed description of the project:

Here's a breakdown of the key components and their functionalities:

1. **Login Form**: 
   - Users need to have valid credentials (login ID and password) to access the system.
   - Upon successful login, users gain access to the main system.

2. **Reservation System**:
   - Users fill in necessary details for making a reservation.
   - Required details may include personal information, train number, class type, date of journey, and origin-destination.
   - Train name can be automatically populated based on the entered train number.
   - After filling in the details, users submit the information by pressing an "Insert" button.

3. **Cancellation Form**:
   - Passengers can initiate the cancellation process by providing their PNR (Passenger Name Record) number.
   - After submitting the PNR number, the system displays all relevant information associated with that specific PNR.
   - Users are then given the option to confirm the cancellation by pressing an "OK" button.

Additional considerations for the system may include:

- **Database Integration**: Data entered during reservations and cancellations should be stored in a central database for easy access and retrieval.
  
- **Authorization and Authentication**: Ensure that only authorized users can access the system by implementing secure login mechanisms.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Design the system interface to be intuitive and easy to use for users of varying technical abilities.

- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to deal with incorrect inputs, database errors, or other issues that may arise during system operation.

- **Security Measures**: Implement security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

- **Confirmation Messages**: Provide clear confirmation messages to users after successful reservations or cancellations to ensure transparency and avoid confusion.
